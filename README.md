Module 12 Challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. In this challenge, I was contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

Accomplishing this task required database and jupyter notebook set up, updating the database and performing an exploratory analysis.
